\title{Markdown flavored Booklit}{index}

I'm a paragraph!

Paragraphs are separated by two blank lines.

Paragraphs can be *really long* with [links](https://example.com) and sometimes
they even contain **strong words** wrapped onto other lines.

> Block quotes begin with a caret,
> And can span multiple lines.

# Headers can contain *italics*!

I can put images like this ... ![booklit](https://vito.github.io/booklit/css/images/booklit.svg) ... in the middle of a sentence!

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## This is a sub-heading.

Here's a sentence in the sub-section.

# Now we're back to the first level.

Cool.

* How about lists?
* Or lists which contain \link{booklit syntax}{https://booklit.dev}?

That's cool, but...

* What about lists...
  
  With multiple paragraphs?
* Woah.

Emphasis on the *italics* and **strong text**.

Or [links](https://google.com)?

What about \italic{**using both**?}.

\preformatted{{
  Hello.
}}

\verbatim{{{
  Hello.

    This is another line.
}}}

    Huh.

    This is another code block.

This is a {\interpolated}invoke.

\basic-invoke

this is a \invoke in a sentence

arguments \can{be} given too

\block{
  Hello.
}
