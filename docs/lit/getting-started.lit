\title{Getting Started}

First you'll need to grab the \code{booklit} CLI. This can be fetched from the
latest \link{GitHub release}{https://github.com/vito/booklit/releases/latest}.
Download the appropriate binary for your platform, \code{chmod +x} it, and drop
it somewhere in your \code{$PATH}.

The \code{chmod}ing and copying can be done in one fell swoop with
\code{install}, like so:

\syntax{bash}{{{
$ install ~/Downloads/booklit_* ~/bin/booklit
}}}

Then, run \code{booklit -v}. You should see the version number printed out,
assuming \code{~/bin} is in your \code{$PATH}.

\table-of-contents

\section{
  \title{Hello, world!}

  First, create a file called \code{hello.lit} with the following content:

  \syntax{booklit}{{{
    \title{Hello, world!}{hello}

    I'm a Booklit document!
  }}}

  Then, run the following to build it as \code{./docs/hello.html}:

  \syntax{bash}{{{
  $ booklit -i hello.lit -o docs
  }}}

  Each of the changes in the following sections will necessitate re-building.
  This can be done by running the above command again.

  Alternatively, you can run \code{booklit} with the \code{-s} flag to start a
  HTTP server showing your generated content:

  \code{{
  $ booklit -i hello.lit -o docs -s 8000
  }}

  Then, browse to
  \link{http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello.html}{http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello.html}.
  When you change anything, just refresh and your content will be rebuilt and
  served.
}

\section{
  \title{Organizing with Sections}

  Next, let's try adding a section within our document:

  \syntax{booklit}{{{
    \title{Hello, world!}{hello}

    I'm a Booklit document!

    \section{
      \title{Hi there!}

      I'm so organized!
    }
  }}}

  Upon building this you should see something like:

  \inset{
    \larger{\larger{\larger{Hello, world!}}}

    I'm a Booklit document!

    \larger{\larger{1 Hi there!}}

    I'm so organized!
  }

  That number "1" might look a bit weird at the moment, but it's the section
  number, and will be something like "3.2" for a nested section. You can always
  remove it by specifying your own template (more on that later), but for now
  let's leave it.
}

\section{
  \title{Splitting Sections}

  To render each sub-section on its own page, simply call
  \code{\\split-sections} somewhere in the section.

  \syntax{booklit}{{{
    \title{Hello, world!}{hello}

    \split-sections

    I'm a Booklit document!

    \section{
      \title{Hi there!}

      I'm so organized!
    }
  }}}

  So far we've just made the section disappear, which isn't very helpful. Let's
  at least make it so we can browse to it! This can be done generally with
  \reference{table-of-contents}:

  \syntax{booklit}{{{
    \title{Hello, world!}{hello}

    \split-sections

    I'm a Booklit document!

    \table-of-contents

    \section{
      \title{Hi there!}

      I'm so organized!
    }
  }}}

  Note that when viewing the sub-section, its header is now a \code{<h1>}
  rather than the \code{<h2>} it was before, since it stands on its own page.
}

\section{
  \title{References & Tagging}

  Having a \reference{table-of-contents} is great and all, but more often
  you'll want to reference sections from each other directly and in context.
  This can be done with \reference{reference}:

  \syntax{booklit}{{{
    \title{Hello, world!}{hello}

    \split-sections

    I'm a Booklit document! To read further, see
    \reference{hi-there}.

    \section{
      \title{Hi there!}

      I'm so organized!
    }
  }}}

  The first argument to \reference{reference} is the name of a tag to link. At
  build time, references will \italic{resolve} to their tag, and generate a
  link to it. By default, the name of the link is determined by the tag, so for
  a section it'll be the section's title. This can be overridden by passing a
  second argument to \reference{reference}:

  \syntax{booklit}{{{
    \title{Hello, world!}{hello}

    \split-sections

    I'm a Booklit document! Consult
    \reference{hi-there}{this section} for more.

    \section{
      \title{Hi there!}

      I'm so organized!
    }
  }}}
}

\section{
  \title{Next Steps}

  What we've gone over should carry you pretty far. But you'll likely want to
  know a lot more.

  \list{
    To learn all the \code{\\functions} you can call in a document
    out-of-the-box, consult \reference{baselit}.
  }{
    To change how your generated content looks, check out the
    \reference{html-renderer}{HTML renderer}.
  }{
    Once you've identified patterns or abstractions that you want to introduce,
    consult \reference{plugins}.
  }
